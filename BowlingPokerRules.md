***COMMON SENSE RULES OF BOWLING POKER (rev 1.2)***

**Section I - Setup**
1.	All bowlers put a $1.00 ante into the pot.  Higher antes can be negotiated but all bowlers must agree.
2.	A standard 52 card deck is shuffled with 2 jokers thrown in.  One joker is marked as ```Bad Joker``` and one is marked ```Good Joker```.
   
**Section II - Main Game**
1.	Bowlers get 2 cards for a strike and 1 card for a spare. If you get consecutive strikes or spares you get to draw one additional card - up to a maximum of 3.  Note that a strike will end a spare streak, and vice-versa.
2.	```Good Joker``` is considered a wild card. ```Bad Joker``` is worth nothing unless the person also has the ```Good Joker```, in which case they have an **unbeatable hand**. 
3.	If a bowler throws a gutter ball, they lose a card (refer to ```Losing a Card``` rules below)
4.	```Losing a Card``` rules
    * Cards are lost in this priority:
        *	Good Joker
        *	Bad Joker
        *	Choice of the guilty bowler
    * Lost card will go back in the draw pile which is to be reshuffled.  
    * If a bowler has no cards to lose, they go ‘in the hole’ and must skip the next card draw.  Negative draws can accumulate with no maximum.
    * If the bowler is losing a non-joker card, they may avoid losing a card by guessing the side of the ball return that their bowling ball will end up on.  This guess must be verbally made prior to their ball returning and no attempt to ‘stack the odds’ will be tolerated (at the commissioner’s discretion)
    * If either joker is placed back in the deck and then that same joker is later re-drawn (by any player), the joker powers are swapped Freaky-Friday style.  Good Joker becomes the Bad Joker and vice versa.  Although unlikely, this can happen multiple times but would not stack (i.e. if both jokers were placed back in the deck before either was redrawn, they only swap once)
5.	If a bowler picks up a split (must be recognized by the scoreboard), they may steal any card from any other player.  If no other player has any cards to steal, nothing happens.
6.	If a bowler pulls either ‘Joker’ on their first card draw and draws no other cards during the bowling match this is considered an ‘unbeatable hand’.  This situation is referred to as a ```Morgan Maneuver```.
7.	If a bowler bowls in the wrong lane, they return all their cards to the deck and start over.  This is known as a ```Holland-daze```.
8.	First strike of each game gets an extra card.  It is acknowledged that this provides an unfair advantage to the order of turns.  That’s why you show up on time, bro.
9.	If a bowler needs to draw a card but the draw pile is empty, they may choose a card at random from the bowler with the most cards (bowler puts his cards face down and gives them a courtesy shuffle).  If the bowler drawing is the bowler with the most cards then the draw is skipped. 

**Section III - End of match**
1.	At the end of the match, the bowler with the lowest natural (non-handicapped) score may draw an additional card.
2.	Before a winner is declared, any bowler may pay the agreed upon ante (see Section 1, Step 1) to draw a single random card from the draw pile.  Each bowler may only do this once and only if there is at least one card in the draw pile.  If the card drawn is the ```good joker``` that is considered an automatic win.
3.	Winner is determined by standard 5 card poker hand rankings
